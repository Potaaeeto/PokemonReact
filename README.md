# Pokemon React - Frontend 🐥

As part of my training at [Le Reacteur](https://www.lereacteur.io/) to become a full-stack developer, we were tasked with building a Pokemon website using [Pokeapi](https://pokeapi.co/)'s API.

_This website is just an exercise and will not be deployed or used, besides as a portfolio piece. All the images used are not my property._

## Overview 🚀

Check out the live demo [here](https://pokemonreact-2024.netlify.app/) and test it! 😊

It is fully responsive for all devices, built using ReactJS, Javascript, HTML, CSS and Axios.
